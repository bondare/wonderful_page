        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Cifas approached Wonderful in order to help advise, design and develop a business first innovation project for the organisation in the form of an online interactive annual report.</p>
        <p>Cifas wanted to lead the way in their sector by providing an online report where the report could be enhanced by making it much more engaging, user friendly and resonate with readers.</p>
        <p>The Cifas team had an in-house videographer so that they could film key executives and staff in order to deliver a much more personalised feel for the viewer. Combined with new editorial, inspiring infographics that contained critical data and
          results and behind the scenes video content, the plan was to WOW both their readers and organisation challenging the way reporting was informed to the market.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>Wonderful worked with Cifas to plan this project and discuss all possibilities. We provided an innovative design that met the brand guidelines but added a new and clean professional tone to the entire report which was designed to encourage the
          engagement.
        </p>
        <p>By breaking content down into sections and sub-pages we aimed to make the annual report more user friendly. By working closely with the client we were able to help and advise on video content offering suggestions and delivering beyond expectations.</p>
        <p>A clever easy-to-navigate system was designed so that users could easily go backward or forwards to key areas so that the report delivered a top class user experience. The report contained a lot of information and video and it was key to keep
          readers interested and not to click off of the report.</p>
        <p>The innovation and thinking behind the design was then enhanced during the development stage by adding animations and fades to enhance the user experience. All the content uploaded and pushed live into the Cifas server.</p>

        <p>“We wanted to approach our annual report with a new, brave and innovative approach like no one in our industry had done so before. This was first for Cifas and we wanted our report to stand out and lead the way with its digital proposition to
          encourage our audiences to engage at a deeper level with our results and company information.</p>
        <p>Wonderful helped us find our way through a series of strategy meetings where they provided their technical and creative intelligence so that we could deliver this brilliant concept to fruition seamlessly. We had a tight time line to turn this
          around and to get the content created. Refreshingly, Wonderful were really understanding of the timescales – turning things around quickly while ensuring the work was of a consistently high standard. Perhaps best of all, the team were all great
          fun to work with. They are clearly experts in their field and this means they are able to take a fearless, creative and confident approach.</p>
        <p>I would be delighted to recommend Wonderful to clients who would like to challenge the status quo of their marketing operations in order to provide truly disruptive and create content that can really engage audiences”</p>
